The plugin automatically calculates the optimal price for products in WooCommerce. Can work as an advisor or in automatic mode.

== Description ==

The **Advanced Conditional Pricing for WooCommerce** plugin is your tool to automatically determine the best prices for your products. This plugin can function as a consultative assistant or be set to an automatic mode to seamlessly integrate optimal pricing strategies into your WooCommerce store.

Leveraging mathematical operations and plugin-specific shortcodes, it allows you to formulate pricing rules. For instance, you can apply charming prices to ensure that all your product prices end with .99 cents, giving a perception of a deal to your customers.

Besides just adjusting prices to appear more attractive, it can intelligently react to your product's sales data to find the optimal price point. If a product hasn't been selling over a specified period, the plugin can be configured to automatically reduce its price, encouraging a potential increase in sales.

Experience a new level of pricing strategy, where technology meets commerce to drive success.

### âœ… How it Works ###

The plugin uses formula to calculate the product prices. You can set the formula by using plugin's shortcodes and mathematical operations.

For example, the formula that automatically modifies the product price, so that it ends with *99* cents:

`
[ceil][product_price][/ceil]-0.01
`
